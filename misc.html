<p>I was the organization chair for the <a href="http://aigicrv.org/aigicrv2016/index.html"> AI GI CRV 2016 conference </a>. This is an international conference with about 200 attendances worldwide and takes four days from May 31 to June 3, 2016, in University of Victoria.</p> 
<p>I coordinated all the logistics for the event, including venues, food services and reception, and student volunteers. The participants drank $10,000 of coffee during these four busy days.</p>
