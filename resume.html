<p>I am a researcher working on interdisciplinary projects between computer graphics rendering and contemporary visual arts. I am interested in investigating the aesthetic aspects of computer-based rendering, and design new algorithms that render beyond photorealism. To apply the rendering technologies in an art-making context is part of my research. I also work as a photographer with digital cameras.</p>

<p>For the last few years, I worked in the <a href="http://gfx.uvic.ca/people/index.php" target="_blank">Graphics Research Group</a> in the computer science department of <a href="http://www.uvic.ca/" target="_blank">University of Victoria</a>. I worked with <a href="http://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/~blob/" target="_blank">Dr. Brian Wyvill</a>, <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/people/gooch-amy" target="_blank">Dr. Amy Gooch</a> and <a href="http://lyndagammon.ca/" target="_blank">Prof. Lynda Gammon</a>. I recently received my ph.D in computer science.</p>

<p> When there is a confusion about the pronunciation of my last name, I usually get called lucky.</p>
