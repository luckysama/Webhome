<p>I am a researcher working on interdisciplinary projects between computer graphics rendering and contemporary visual arts. I am interested in investigating the aesthetic aspects of computer-based rendering, and design new algorithms that render beyond the realm of photorealism. To apply the rendering technologies in an art-making context is the central theme of my research. I also work as a photographer with digital cameras.</p>

<p>I recently received my ph.D in computer science from <a href="http://www.uvic.ca/">University of Victoria.</a></p>

<p> When there is a confusion about the pronunciation of my last name, I usually get called lucky.</p>
